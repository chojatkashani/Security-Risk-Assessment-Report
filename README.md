# Security-Risk-Assessment-Report

## Part 1: Hardening Tools and Methods

Three hardening tools and methods the organization can implement to mitigate vulnerabilities include:

1. **Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
2. **Setting and Enforcing Strong Password Policies**
3. **Performing Regular Firewall Maintenance**

### **1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
MFA requires users to provide **more than one verification method** before accessing an application.  
Common MFA methods include:
- **Fingerprint scans**
- **ID cards**
- **PIN numbers**
- **Passwords**

### **2. Strong Password Policies**
Password policies should enforce:
- **Minimum password length**
- **Use of special characters**
- **Restrictions on password reuse**
- **Lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts** (e.g., suspending accounts after **five unsuccessful attempts**)

### **3. Firewall Maintenance**
Regular firewall maintenance ensures that security configurations remain **updated** to protect against **emerging threats**.  
Essential firewall tasks include:
- **Regularly reviewing firewall rules**
- **Blocking suspicious traffic sources**
- **Updating configurations after security incidents**

## Part 2: Recommendations and Justification

### **1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
Enforcing **MFA** adds an **extra layer of security**, reducing the likelihood of **unauthorized access** through:  
- **Brute force attacks**  
- **Password sharing** (since an additional authentication factor is required)

### **2. Strong Password Policies**
A well-enforced password policy makes it significantly harder for **malicious actors** to compromise accounts.  
Key benefits include:
- **Preventing brute force attacks** by locking accounts after repeated failed attempts
- **Increasing password complexity** to slow down password-cracking attempts
- **Restricting password reuse** to prevent credential stuffing attacks

### **3. Firewall Maintenance**
Firewall maintenance is **critical** for defending against **Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks**.  
To enhance security:
- **Ensure firewall rules reflect the latest security standards**
- **Blacklist IPs associated with malicious activities**
- **Update rules immediately after security incidents**

---

By implementing **MFA, strong password policies, and proactive firewall maintenance**, the organization can **significantly reduce security risks** and **strengthen its defense against cyber threats**.
